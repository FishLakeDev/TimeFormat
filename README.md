# TimeFormat
Plugin for SA-MP 0.3.7-R1/R3-1/R4

This script changes the format of TimeStamp. Was taken as a basis (https://blast.hk/threads/25438/).  
Differences:
* There is no command /timeformat to change timestamp in game.
* Milliseconds (%MM) added.
* Works on versions: 0.3.7-R1, 0.3.7-R3-1, 0.3.7-R4
